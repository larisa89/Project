5.	I do have a lot of experience using awk and sed commands, and I have used them mostly in bash shell scripting. I have used the awk command to manipulate data and generate output, while the sed command I have used in scripting, to find and replace strings of words, or replace a line in script. I use the sed command when I want to edit a script, without vim into the file.
